# a-simple-queue-ticketing-application

## Why did I make this application
I was asked to make this application in an interview test

## How to run

first run `npm install` to install all dependencies 

run `npm index.js` then go to (http://localhost:3000) if it doesn't work
then that mean you have the PORT environment variable set to some value
if that is the case then replace 3000 with the value of the PORT variable
(and make sure there is no application running at the same port)

for the managegment website, go to (http://localhost:3000/management)
